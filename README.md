This ensures a smooth and efficient transfer of patients to the appropriate healthcare professionals.

### 4. Insurance Module

The Insurance Module allows patients to explore and acquire health insurance plans based on their age, medical history, and other relevant details. It simplifies the insurance process, making it easier for patients to secure coverage tailored to their specific needs.

### 5. Appointment Scheduling

Patients can schedule appointments with doctors through the system. The Appointment Scheduling feature provides a user-friendly interface for selecting available time slots, making it convenient for patients to manage their healthcare appointments.
